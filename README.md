# Code-Challenge-Is_Walk
This is a code challenge that I have created a solution for. 
The prompt descripted a set of directions that were given on a list for an imaginary person to follow. 
There were four directions for movement. (n = north, s = south, e = east, w = west).
Each direction given took 1 minute for the person to carry out. 
The person must carry out the directions within 10 minutes and return to his starting point.
